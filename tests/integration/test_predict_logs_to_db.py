"""End-to-end: POST /predict -> SELECT FROM predictions_log_test.

Runs only when ``TEST_DATABASE_URL`` is set in the environment (CI secret
or local override). Without it, the whole module skips gracefully so the
default test suite stays self-contained.

Every test cleans up after itself by deleting its own row. The CI workflow
also runs a TRUNCATE at job end as a safety net.
